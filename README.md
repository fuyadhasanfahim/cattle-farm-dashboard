## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally and get it running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or higher)
-   npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun (package manager of your choice)
-   MongoDB (for database)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cattle-farm-dashboard.git
    cd cattle-farm-dashboard
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or

3. **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
